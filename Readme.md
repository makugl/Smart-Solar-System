<h1>Smart Solar System</h1><br/>

This project aimed to use a solar system more efficiently. The prototype was able to read out the data from the solar system in real time and compare it with the current electricity consumption to determine whether additional devices could be switched on. This was done using a Raspberry Pi and Python. Furthermore, a Vosk interface for a voice assistant was integrated.
